				4. Ask user to enter your age
						(age can not be negative or greater than 120)

				8. Ask the user if his/her car has an anti-theft device (Yes/No)
						(if user enters invalid entry, ask the user to re-enter until user provides a valid entry)

			Calculate the price of the insurance and display all the info of the user

				Insurance Quote calculation:
					starting prices for liability:

						age >= 25 ==> 50

						miles <= 10 ====> $10
					    miles > 10 and miles <= 50 ==> $30
					    miles > 50 ===>  $50

					starting prices for full coverage:

						age >= 25 ==> 120

						miles <= 10 ====> $20
					    miles > 10 and miles <= 50 ==> $40
					    miles > 50 ===>  $70


				    If the car has anti-theft device ==> 5% discount
				    If he/she had any accidents or claims in past 5 years ===> 15% extra charge
				    If he/she never had any accidents or claims in past 5 years ==> 10% discount
